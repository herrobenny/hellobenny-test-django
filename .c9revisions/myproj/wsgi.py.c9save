It should expose a module-level variable\nnamed ``application``. Django's ``runserver`` and ``runfcgi`` commands discover\nthis application via the ``WSGI_APPLICATION`` setting.\n\nUsually you will have the standard Django WSGI application here, but it also\nmight make sense to replace the whole Django WSGI application with a custom one\nthat later delegates to the Django one. For example, you could introduce WSGI\nmiddleware here, or combine a Django application with an application of another\nframework.\n\n\"\"\"\nimport os\n\nos.environ.setdefault(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\", \"myproj.settings\")\n\n# This application object is used by any WSGI server configured to use this\n# file.
